Laser script is a javascript program for my current project where im using a laser from VLASE laser family to mark pump covers.

It uses predefined classes to control stepper motor regulator, pneaumatic valves, reads sensor states etc...
It creates GUI on a touch screen monitor trough which operater can use laser for automatic or manual marking.
